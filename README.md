# Operation-Hired
A simplistic portfolio of my showcased talents in the dev world.
This is an example of some of the concepts that I have retained since starting the program on the 13th of FEB. I have a long way to go but I am impressed with what I am able to create. I believe the navigation bar is my best work so far. I was also able to use the hover feature which I think is pretty cool.
