# Blurb
A simplistic portfolio of my showcased talents in the dev world.
This is an example of some of the concepts that I have retained since starting the program on the 13th of FEB. 
I have a long way to go but I am impressed with what I am able to create. 
I believe the navigation bar is my best work so far. 
I was also able to use the hover feature which I think is pretty cool. 

USER STORY:
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
